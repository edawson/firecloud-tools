FireCloud-Tools
-----------------------------
Dockerfiles and WDL descriptors for tools I use in FireCloud  
Eric T Dawson

### Organization
Each top-level subdirectory holds WDL descriptions and Dockerfiles pertaining to the tool
the directory is named after. Test data and other cruft is also in these subdirectories (if it is there at all).

### Getting docker images
All of the docker images for corresponding software should be available in [my Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/erictdawson/)

### Getting help
Please reach out to me via Github for help!
