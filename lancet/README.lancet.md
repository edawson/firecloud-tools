LANCET
------

Lancet is a tool for calling indels ( on the order of 1-100s) or bases from Giuseppe Narzisi at NYGC.
Its runtime is determined by the window size, the number of cores used, and the intervals.

It is tested out to a window size of 1000 but not much farther.

Memory usage grows with window size, not interval size.
